NOTE: This is made for LTSC 2019 (``Version 1809 / Windows 10 Build 17763.*``)

== Instructions

* Install link:https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25016/[Intel ethernet driver] (if using one)
. Install link:https://dl.bitsum.com/files/processlassosetup64.exe[Process Lasso] from Bitsum; better thread scheduling and the best power plan ("Bitsum Highest Performance")
. Enable the following options in your motherboard's BIOS:
** I/O APIC (IOAPIC 24-119 Entries)
** Above 4G Decoding
** Resizable BAR [NOTE: If Windows cannot boot (due to using MBR instead of GPT), disable this]
. Configure the options located inside `shiny_windows-10.bat` before running it.

== Potential undesirables
* Insider builds will be disabled; **never re-enable it**, it will revert your own changes and this script on every update
* Wallpaper is changed to a static colour to avoid loading an image/wallpaper into memory, where it'd reside until changed
* System mitigations are disabled, and so is UAC; inorder to actually secure your system (system mitigations as a whole are irrelevant)
** Keep amount of software installed to a minimum
** Make JavaScript disabled by default (using uMatrix), and do not enable Javascript on sites you don't require; it's easier to find good websites worth your time with JavaScript disabled +

** Updating software can expose direct risks, given its source had been compromised (such as with CCleaner)
** Not updating software can expose indirect risks, exploits which need to be utilized by someone specifically targetting your machine (no chance for most people)
